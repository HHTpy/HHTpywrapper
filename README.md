Python Wrapper for Hilbert–Huang Transform MATLAB Package
=========================================================

HHTpywrapper is a python interface to call Hilbert–Huang Transform (HHT) MATLAB package and plot results by Matplotlib. 
HHT is an empirical method to decompose a signal into basis components, called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), based on the signal itself, and transform these components into instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes as functions of time. HHT has found many applications in different scientific and engineering fields, and it work well for signals generated by non-stationary and non-linear processes.

Requirements
------------
- Python
- MATLAB
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib
- [pymatbridge](https://github.com/arokem/python-matlab-bridge) (A simple Python => MATLAB(R) interface and a matlab magic for ipython)


HHT MATLAB package
------------------
You can freely download the source codes of the package from [the website of Research Center for Adaptive Data Analysis](http://rcada.ncu.edu.tw/research1.htm). However, this package is already included in this repository.
